# This the repo for the Flmesh meshtastic map devices to allow for easier intergration in other regional groups maps.

I'll be updating it periodically with new images, as new devices come online with firmware support.
Pull requests with new images and updated images are welcome.


* The goal is to keep this up to date with the highest quality images for each device available, preferably with fully transparent backgrounds, to improve map quality when using with dark mode browers.
